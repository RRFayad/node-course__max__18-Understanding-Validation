277. Module Introduction
    - Resetting Passwords
     -Authorization

278. Resetting Passwords
    * For resetting passwords, we are gonna start working with new views and new routes
        - New view
        - New Controller
        - New Route

279. Implementing the Token Logic

    - We used crypto node library, to generate random token:
        * Check exports.postReset()

    - We then save it to the User in DB (we had to create this option in the User model)

    - After that, we created a view that should be displayed when the user get to the reset route, with the tokne in params (it was going to be sent via email - but Im having trouble setting up this)
        * This page will allow us to create a new password

282. Adding Logic to Update the Password

    * No new concepts, also I did it by myself
     
283. Why we Need Authorization & 284. Adding Authorization

    - To restrict permissions of an User
        - We don't want to let an User edit / delete a product created by another User

    - Just added a filter in admin getProducts()

285. Adding Protection to Post Actions

    - Just updated some logic to the check in the post requests if I am loggid in with the right User
